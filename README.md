# Food-App


Every year millions of people die from starvation. Studies have shown that a child dies from hunger every 10 seconds.
Although the world produces enough food to feed the entire population, hunger is still prevalent in many countries. This is because the food is not distributed properly. This app tries to mitigate this issue by taking food from the surplus (Hotels and others) and giving it to those who need it the most (NGOs).
